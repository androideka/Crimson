Crimson Interview Project

This project will score a game of bowling. As I don't have the constraints yet, I'm going to make several assumptions here. Should I create a Bowling class? Should I create a standalone function? Surely it should be simple enough not to need a class. Will the function be called every time there is an update? Or, will the class have to act on its own to take outside resources (pin count) and act upon them? Come on, Zheng. Send me that email.

Assignment

The purpose of this exercise is to give our team some insight into how you approach problems - there is no "right" or "wrong" answer. Please complete and return the attached exercise to Cristine Barger (bargerc@advisory.com) within one week of receiving it. Do not hesitate to reach out to Cristine with questions. 
Problem statement:
Imagine you’re tasked with writing the software for a bowling alley that shows the bowling game scoreboard.
Design entities and interfaces to model a scoreboard controller for bowling, keeping in mind the nature of the input from the physical machinery in the bowling lane, which generally reflects pin state.
The input to the scoreboard controller is the lane control hardware that reflects the pin state (i.e. how many pins are up/down).

Your Task: 
Using your design, implement (in the programming language of your choosing) the scoring / game state display service that would compute needed data that one typically expects to see on the lane monitor during a game.
