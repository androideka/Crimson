Crimson Interview Project

This project will score a game of bowling. As I don't have the constraints yet, I'm going to make several assumptions here. Should I create a Bowling class? Should I create a standalone function? Surely it should be simple enough not to need a class. Will the function be called every time there is an update? Or, will the class have to act on its own to take outside resources (pin count) and act upon them? Come on, Zheng. Send me that email.
