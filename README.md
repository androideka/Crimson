Crimson Interview Project

Assignment

The purpose of this exercise is to give our team some insight into how you approach problems - there is no "right" or "wrong" answer. Please complete and return the attached exercise to Cristine Barger (bargerc@advisory.com) within one week of receiving it. Do not hesitate to reach out to Cristine with questions. 
Problem statement:
Imagine you’re tasked with writing the software for a bowling alley that shows the bowling game scoreboard.
Design entities and interfaces to model a scoreboard controller for bowling, keeping in mind the nature of the input from the physical machinery in the bowling lane, which generally reflects pin state.
The input to the scoreboard controller is the lane control hardware that reflects the pin state (i.e. how many pins are up/down).

Your Task: 
Using your design, implement (in the programming language of your choosing) the scoring / game state display service that would compute needed data that one typically expects to see on the lane monitor during a game.

Might (didn't test on a computer I wasn't developing on) require installing PySide:  sudo apt-get install pyside-tools

Run startgame.py to begin application.

WOOOOOOO!!! Got the job.
